My research is located at the semantics-pragmatics interface including both theoretical modelling as well as empirical methods. 
### Cleft Sentences in German (and other languages)
### Discourse Expectations
### Experimental Pragmatics
Me and my colleagues conducted experiments on exhaustivity of cleft sentences comparing German, Hungarian, French, and English (more details [here](http://www.xprag.de/?page_id=94)). We used a novel mouse-driven picture verifcation/falsification task. Furthermore, I conducted several rating studies comparing clefts and definite descriptions, and clefts and canonical sentences. In general, I am interested in new experimental designs that aim for making the experimental set-up as natural as possible.
