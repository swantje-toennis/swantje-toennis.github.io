My research is located at the *semantics-pragmatics interface* with a focus on discourse phenomena, including both theoretical modelling as well as empirical methods. I wrote my dissertation on German *cleft sentences in discourse*. Currently, I am working on *discourse expectations* in relation to different linguistic phenomena.
### Cleft Sentences
In my dissertation, I investigated cleft sentences, mainly in German, from different perspectives, such as their function as expressing contrast, exhaustivity, marking focus, and especially how clefts contribute to the discourse structure. I proposed that clefts are used to address a rather unexpected question in the context, I provided empirical evidence for these claims in collaboration with Judith Tonhauser. I analyzed corpus examples of clefts in a wider context instead of constructed examples with no or little context. 
### Discourse Expectations
Currently, I am extending the discourse model which I introduced in my PhD thesis and which aims to incorporate discourse expectations into a QUD-based discourse model, as I did in an information theoretic framework. I am interested in how different linguistic phenomena, such as discourse particles, non-canonical word order, cleft constructions, etc., affect the expectations of the addressee about the further development of the discourse. 
### Experimental Pragmatics
Me and my colleagues conducted experiments on exhaustivity of cleft sentences comparing German, Hungarian, French, and English (more details <a href="http://www.xprag.de/?page_id=94" target="_blank">here</a>). We used a novel mouse-driven picture verification/falsification task. Furthermore, I conducted several rating studies comparing clefts and definite descriptions, and clefts and canonical sentences. Recently, I have explored different experimental methods to measure QUDs and the interaction of different QUD-sensitive phenomena. In general, I am interested in new experimental designs that aim for making the experimental set-up as natural as possible.
