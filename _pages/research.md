My research is located at the semantics-pragmatics interface including both theoretical modelling as well as empirical methods. I wrote my dissertation on German cleft sentences in discourse. Currently, I am working on discourse expectations in relation to different linguistic phenomena.
### Cleft Sentences
In my dissertation, I investigated cleft sentences, mainly in German, from different perspectives, such as their function as expressing contrast, exhaustivity, marking focus, and especially how clefts contribute to the discourse structure. I propose that clefts are used to address a rather unexpected question in the context. I analyzed corpus examples of clefts in a wider context instead of constructed examples with no or little context. 
### Discourse Expectations
Currently, I am extending the discourse model which I introduced in my PhD thesis and which aims to incorporate discourse expectations into a QUD-based discourse model. I am interested in how different linguistic phenomena, such as discourse particles, non-canonical word order, cleft constructions, etc., affect the expectations of the addressee about the further development of the discourse. 
### Experimental Pragmatics
Me and my colleagues conducted experiments on exhaustivity of cleft sentences comparing German, Hungarian, French, and English (more details [here](http://www.xprag.de/?page_id=94)). We used a novel mouse-driven picture verifcation/falsification task. Furthermore, I conducted several rating studies comparing clefts and definite descriptions, and clefts and canonical sentences. In general, I am interested in new experimental designs that aim for making the experimental set-up as natural as possible.
