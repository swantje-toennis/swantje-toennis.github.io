I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of English Linguistics at the University of Stuttgart. I did my PhD at the University of GÃ¶ttingen (Germany) as part of the XPrag project [Exhaustivity in Cleft Sentences](http://www.xprag.de/?page_id=94) and at the University of Graz (Austria) in the [Research group theoretical and empirical linguistics](https://germanistik.uni-graz.at/en/research-group-theoretical-and-empirical-linguistics/). My dissertation is concerned with the discourse function of German *es*-clefts and proposes a question-based discourse model that includes discourse expectations.
