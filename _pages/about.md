I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of English Linguistics (<a href="https://www.ling.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/ifla/" target="_blank"> IfLA </a>) at the University of Stuttgart. I did my PhD in General Linguistics at the University of GÃ¶ttingen (Germany) as part of the XPrag.de project <a href="http://www.xprag.de/?page_id=94" target="_blank"> Exhaustivity in Cleft Sentences </a> and at the University of Graz (Austria) in the <a href="https://germanistik.uni-graz.at/en/research-group-theoretical-and-empirical-linguistics/" target="_blank"> Research group theoretical and empirical linguistics </a>. My dissertation is concerned with the discourse function of German *es*-clefts and proposes a question-based discourse model that includes discourse expectations.

My [research interests](https://swantje-toennis.github.io/research/) are located at the semantics-pragmatics interface, in particular the following topics:
* Cleft sentences in German (and other languages)
* Expectations in discourse
* Information structure
* Experimental pragmatics
* Formal (QUD-based) discourse modelling
* Probabilistic pragmatics

I teach courses in semantics, pragmatics, syntax, and the interfaces at BA and MA level (see my courses [here](https://swantje-toennis.github.io/teaching/)).

Outside of academia, I enjoy bouldering, rock climbing, and singing in the choir.
