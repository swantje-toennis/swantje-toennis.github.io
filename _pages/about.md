I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of English Linguistics ([IfLA](https://www.ling.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/ifla/)) at the University of Stuttgart. I did my PhD in General Linguistics at the University of GÃ¶ttingen (Germany) as part of the XPrag.de project [Exhaustivity in Cleft Sentences](http://www.xprag.de/?page_id=94) and at the University of Graz (Austria) in the [Research group theoretical and empirical linguistics](https://germanistik.uni-graz.at/en/research-group-theoretical-and-empirical-linguistics/). My dissertation is concerned with the discourse function of German *es*-clefts and proposes a question-based discourse model that includes discourse expectations.

My [research interests](https://swantje-toennis.github.io/research/) are located at the semantics-pragmatics interface, in particular the following topics:
* Cleft sentences in German (and other languages)
* Expectations in Discourse
* Experimental Pragmatics
* Formal (QUD-based) discourse modelling
* Probabilistic Pragmatics

I am teaching courses in semantics, pragmatics, and the interface (see my courses [here](https://swantje-toennis.github.io/teaching/)).
